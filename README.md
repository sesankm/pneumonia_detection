# pneumonia_detection

## Overview
* Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/khoongweihao/covid19-xray-dataset-train-test-sets
* neural network that diagnosis penumonia in x-rays
* vectorizes, resizes, and flattens x-rays
* image vectors aren't normalized to preserve RGB values, which help in determining whether or not penumonia is present

## Model Performance
<strong>Validation Accuracy:</strong> 0.98<br>
